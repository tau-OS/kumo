# Kumo Shell

The Kumo (é›²) Shell is a shell for the Wayfire compositor written in Rust. It makes use of Wayfire's JSON-RPC(?) socket to communicate with the compositor and provides a user-friendly graphical shell for Wayfire.

The Kumo Shell is part of the tauOS project, and part of the KIRI Desktop Environment.

> [!NOTE]
> This code is still in development and is not ready for use.
> It is currently at the experimental stage, as we have to implement the Wayfire RPC protocol in Rust.
